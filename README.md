# windows.binary.data.extractor
The Binary Data Extractor is a Windows desktop utility that can extract files that have been stored in a Microsoft SQL database as Binary Large Object (BLOB).

This can be very helpful if you are migrating your files from a custom or legacy application to a system like Documentum, SharePoint, or SiteCore.

Your SQL query must include 'FileName' and 'FileData' as the two column names.   As you can see in the screenshot below, you can attach meaningful data to the file name just include.
